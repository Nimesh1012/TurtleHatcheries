        <h1>Turtle Species in Sri Lanka</h1>
        <p>Sri Lanka is famous for its<a href="https://nexttravelsrilanka.com/beaches-in-sri-lanka/"> <em>lovely
            beaches</em></a> and<a
                href="https://nexttravelsrilanka.com/the-amazing-beauty-of-the-wildlife-in-sri-lanka/"> <em>amazing
            wildlife</em></a>. Among the many types of wildlife found in Sri Lanka, turtles are indeed one of the most
            attractive and precious. Out of the 7 types of turtles in the world, the sea of Sri Lanka provides habitat
            to 5 types. Among the five turtle species found in the Sri Lankan ocean, three are endangered, one is
            vulnerable and one is critically endangered. They visit the Sri Lankan shores to nest. In fact, there is a
            high population of sea turtles on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. So, they are in need of conservation. And
            that is the place where the turtle hatcheries come on stage.</p>


        <p>Baby Turtles! Yes, this might be the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear about turtle
            hatcheries. But believe us, there is much more you will experience if you visit the turtle hatcheries on
            this beautiful island. Continue reading to know all about the turtles and turtles hatcheries in Sri
            Lanka!</p>

            <br/>
            <p>Green Turtles are the most common type of turtle in the ocean of Sri Lanka. They got their name because
                of the color of fat found under their upper shell. They can grow to a maximum length of 1m and can weigh
                around 250kg. Green Turtles have a smaller head and a pair of large flippers.</p>

            <p>Adult female Green turtles lay between 120-140 eggs at one time. Their eggs take up to 48 days to hatch.
                They lay eggs several times in one season. But they will only nest once every few years. Young turtles
                are carnivorous while the grown green turtles feed on marine vegetation.</p>

                <img src="file:///Users/nimeshamadhushan/Downloads/turtle-hatchery/img/Hawaksbill.png" alt="Hawksbill Turtles"/>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <p>The Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a critically endangered species of sea turtle known for
                its distinctive appearance. Named after its beak-like mouth that resembles that of a hawk, the Hawksbill
                turtle has a flattened body shape and a carapace with overlapping scales forming a serrated pattern.
                Their carapace displays a beautiful combination of colors including brown, amber, black, and orange.
                Adult Hawksbill turtles typically reach lengths of 2 to 3 feet and weigh around 100 to 150 pounds,
                although larger individuals can be found. These turtles inhabit tropical and subtropical waters of the
                Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, favoring coral reefs, rocky areas, lagoons, and coastal waters.
                Hawksbill turtles are primarily spongivorous, feeding on sponges, but they also consume other
                invertebrates such as jellyfish, sea anemones, shrimp, and squid. Their feeding habits play a crucial
                role in maintaining the health of coral reef ecosystems, as they prevent sponges from overgrowing and
                outcompeting corals. Unfortunately, Hawksbill turtles are facing numerous threats that have led to their
                critically endangered status. These include habitat loss, climate change, pollution, bycatch in fishing
                gear, and illegal wildlife trade for their beautiful tortoiseshell. Conservation efforts are vital to
                protect and preserve this remarkable species for future generations..</p>

            <p>The Olive Ridley Turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) is a species of sea turtle found in various parts of the
                world, including Sri Lanka. These turtles are named for their olive-colored carapace, or shell. They are
                relatively small in size, with adults typically measuring about 2-2.5 feet (60-75 cm) in length and
                weighing around 75-100 pounds (34-45 kg). Olive Ridley Turtles have a distinctive heart-shaped shell and
                a relatively small head with a hooked beak. They have powerful flippers, which enable them to navigate
                through the ocean waters with agility.
                <br>
                <br>
                These turtles have a primarily omnivorous diet, feeding on a variety of marine organisms such as
                jellyfish, shrimp, crabs, and algae. They are highly adapted to life in the ocean and are capable of
                diving to considerable depths in search of food.

            </div>
            <br/>
            <p>The Loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) is a species of sea turtle found in various locations worldwide,
                including Sri Lanka. These turtles are characterized by their large heads and reddish-brown or
                yellow-brown carapace. Growing up to about three feet in length and weighing around 250 pounds on
                average, Loggerhead turtles possess strong swimming flippers. While they are less common than Green
                turtles in Sri Lanka, Loggerhead turtles can occasionally be spotted in the coastal waters. Like other
                sea turtles, Loggerheads engage in nesting behavior, with females coming ashore to lay their eggs on
                sandy beaches. However, the nesting activity of Loggerheads in Sri Lanka is comparatively less frequent.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                As with all sea turtles, Loggerheads face threats such as habitat degradation, pollution, entanglement
                in fishing gear, and poaching. Conservation efforts are essential to protect Loggerhead turtles and
                their nesting sites. Local marine biologists, conservation organizations, and projects in Sri Lanka work
                towards monitoring, researching, and educating communities to safeguard these remarkable creatures and
                their habitats. If interested in observing Loggerhead turtles, it is advisable to consult with local
                experts who can provide specific information on sightings and responsible turtle-watching practices.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>The Leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) is a remarkable species of sea turtle
                known for its unique characteristics and worldwide distribution. It is the largest of all sea turtles,
                reaching lengths of up to 7 feet (2.13 meters) and weights of over 2,000 pounds (907 kilograms). Unlike
                other sea turtles, the Leatherback lacks a hard shell and instead has a leathery carapace with ridges
                that
                resemble an ancient mariner's armor.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Leatherback turtles are found in both warm and cold waters, inhabiting all major oceans. They undertake
                some
                of the longest migrations of any marine creature, with individuals traveling thousands of miles between
                feeding and nesting grounds. These magnificent creatures are known to dive to astonishing depths,
                descending
                to over 4,200 feet (1,280 meters) in search of their favorite prey, jellyfish.</p>
            <h3>Where you have a chance to see Leatherback Turtle</h3>
            <ul class="descLi">
                <li><strong>Kosgoda Beach:</strong> Along the southwestern coast, Kosgoda Beach is another significant
                    nesting site for Leatherback Turtles. The Kosgoda Turtle Conservation Project, operating in this area, plays a vital
                    role in protecting these turtles and educating visitors about their conservation needs.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pigeon Island National Park:</strong> Located off the east coast of Sri Lanka near Nilaveli,
                    Pigeon Island
                    National Park is known for its vibrant coral reefs and diverse marine life, including Leatherback turtles.
                    Snorkeling or diving in the crystal-clear waters of Pigeon Island provides opportunities to spot
                    these magnificent creatures.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Rekawa Beach:</strong> Situated on the south coast of Sri Lanka, Rekawa Beach is renowned
                    for its turtle
                    nesting activity. It is one of the most important nesting sites for sea turtles, including Green
                    turtles, in the country. Conservation organizations such as the Leatherback Turtle Watch operate guided
                    tours to observe nesting turtles during the nesting season.
